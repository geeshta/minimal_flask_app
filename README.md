A simple flask app used for checking if your server and WSGI configuration are correct and you can actually run a flask app on your server. It's not literally the smallest possible flask app, that would be just one simple file. It has a form of a module, has some very basic structure and renders an actual html template with a "secret" functionality.

You made need to uncomment the first two lines of the wsgi file and replace the placeholder string with an actuall path to the parent folder
